# Burgerize

## Description

Burgerize uses express-handlebars along with mySQL to highlight the tastiest burgers ever imaginable. Clicking the devour button in the burgers to devour section will move that burger into the devoured section. Furthermore, users can add another custom burger via the add a burger form, sending that burger to the ready to be devoured section.
